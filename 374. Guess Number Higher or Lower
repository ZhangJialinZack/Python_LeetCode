374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.


Python代码：
import random

class Solution(object):
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        low = 0     # 猜数区间起点
        high = n+1  # 猜数区间终点
        while(low + 1 < high):
            num = random.randint((low+1), (high-1))  # 随机生成介于（low，high）之间的整数
            if(guess(num) == 0): # 猜中直接返回结果
                return num
            elif(guess(num) < 0):# 猜的数大了  更改区间终点为所猜数字
                high = num
            else:                # 猜的数小了  更改区间起点为所猜数字
                low = num
                
        return high-1            # 此处也可以改成 low+1  即返回介于两个相差为2的数字之间的数字

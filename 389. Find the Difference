389. Find the Difference
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.


Python代码：
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # 方法一 判断字符出现的次数
        # hash_t = set(t)
        # for k in hash_t:
        #     if(s.count(k) != t.count(k)):
        #         return k
                
        # 方法二
        from collections import Counter
        
        return (collections.Counter(t)-collections.Counter(s)).keys().pop()

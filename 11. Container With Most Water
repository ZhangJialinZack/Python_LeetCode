11. Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.


Python代码：
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        maxA = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        maxA = 0
        while(left < right):
            tmpA = (right-left)*min(height[left], height[right])  # 求能装的水的面积公式
            if(tmpA > maxA):
                maxA = tmpA
            if(height[left] > height[right]):
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
        return maxA

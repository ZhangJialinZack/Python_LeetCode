268. Missing Number
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

Python代码:
class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # 方法一  set集合相减  得出结果
        # return (set(range(len(nums)+1))-set(nums)).pop()
        
        # 方法二  算数推导
        return sum(range(len(nums)+1)) - sum(nums)

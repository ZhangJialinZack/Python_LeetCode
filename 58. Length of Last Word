58. Length of Last Word
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

For example, 
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.


Python代码：
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        tS = s.strip(' ')
        i = len(tS)-1
        count = 0
        while(i >= 0 and tS[i] != ' '):
            i -= 1
            count += 1
        return count

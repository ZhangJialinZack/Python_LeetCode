136. Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


Python代码：
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # 任何相同数字的"^"等于0   任何数字"^"0等于它本身
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, nums)
